# LTRATO-2600
The demand for automated and stable networks grows in the world of agile applications and infrastructures which are more distributed and complex than before. 
Networks are no longer isolated segments and must be adjusted where business intent and cross-domain insights drive network changes. 
Cross-domain automation seamlessly connects multiple domains, enabling continuous delivery using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and integration of updates across all the network infrastructure. 
By leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs), operators can deploy advanced troubleshooting use cases. These AI-driven solutions proactively identify, diagnose, and resolve network issues, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing downtime. Integrating AI within CI/CD frameworks ensures that updates and fixes are deployed. Splunk will serve as the data lake for network monitoring. This will ensure that telemetry data are analysed to maintain a healthy environment.

During the lab execution, you will work with:

** GitLab, Docker, Ansible for Infrastructure as Code, pyATS, Splunk
** NetBox, ServiceNow
** Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller, Cisco Catalyst Center, Cisco Security Cloud Control
** Local large language model (LLM)
